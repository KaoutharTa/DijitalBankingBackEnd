<h1>Backend Architecture for Digital Banking Application</h1>
    
  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The backend of the digital banking application is built using the Spring Framework. It is designed to handle various aspects of banking operations, emphasizing security and efficiency in data management and transaction processing.</p>

  <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <h3>Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AccountHistoryDTO, AccountOperationDTO, BankAccountDTO:</strong> These DTOs carry necessary data related to account transactions and operations between the server and clients.</li>
        <li><strong>CurrentBankAccountDTO, SavingBankAccountDTO:</strong> Specific DTOs for different types of bank accounts, supporting specialized operations for each.</li>
        <li><strong>CustomerDTO:</strong> Manages data transfer concerning customer information.</li>
    </ul>

   <h3>Entities and Enums</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AccountStatus, OperationType:</strong> Enums to define constant values for account statuses and operation types to ensure consistency across the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Entities like AccountOperation, BankAccount, Customer, etc.:</strong> These represent the application's core business logic and are mapped directly to the database schema.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Repositories</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AccountOperationRepository, BankAccountRepository, CustomerRepository:</strong> Interfaces for managing database interactions for account operations, bank accounts, and customer data, respectively.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>BankAccountService, BankService:</strong> Core service components that handle business logic related to bank operations and transactions.</li>
    </ul>

   <h3>Security</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SecurityConfig:</strong> Configures security settings for the application, managing authentication and authorization.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Web Controllers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>BankAccountRestAPI, CustomerRestController:</strong> Controllers that expose RESTful APIs to handle requests related to bank accounts and customer management.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Configuration and Execution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DigitalBankingBackendApplication:</strong> The main class that starts the Spring Boot application.</li>
        <li><strong>application.properties:</strong> Contains configuration settings for the application, such as database connection details and application-specific properties.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This structured approach using Spring ensures that the backend is robust, secure, and capable of handling complex business requirements and operations of a digital banking platform.</p>
